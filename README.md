# To Do

## This project is a personal project to figure out how we can store YouTube videos in Plex under the TV Shows Directory or in
a custom directory.

I would like to figure out how to have the following structure of the YT directory
```
-> YouTube
 --> Channel 
  ---> Playlists
  ---> Episodes 
```
